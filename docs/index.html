              <p>This tool helps with Farming simulator mod folder management by allowing you to automatically switch between mod folders with the click of a button.&nbsp;
			  It also helps with server mod management for people that play on multiple servers by allowing you to connect a server to a particular button and automatically downloading mods from the server when they change.&nbsp;
			  This tool also makes it easy for sharing server information with friends. Simply export the button and send it to them and they can import the button and BAM it&#x27;ll create a new folder for them, have the appropriate search tag for the server, and download all the mods.&nbsp;
			  It will even give them the password. Has anybody ever told you to delete your shader cache or delete your log file but you didn&#x27;t know where it&#x27;s at?&nbsp;
			  Well, this app has a button to click to do that for you. Now you don&#x27;t have to worry about where it&#x27;s at.</p>			
			  
			  <p>Why is it good to have seperate mod folders? Some mods and/or maps have conflicts/issues when they are in the same mod folder.</p>
			  
			  <p>Why did I make this mod manager? I manage a Farming Simulator dedicated server for a YouTuber and their helpers.&nbsp;
			  The administration, and notification I had to give to everyone whenever I updated mods just took too much of my personal time (I'm not being paid for it after all).&nbsp;
			  I needed a mod manager that was easy to install, easy to use and updated mods from a dedicated server automatically, so I built one.&nbsp;
			  It also works very well if you are not using a dedicated server (single user).</p>
			
			  <p>Currently this tool is for Windows only, I may consider porting it to Mac at some point if there is demand for it.</p>
